After creating the docker file
Now build the image for linux platform with calculator tag

docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t calculator:v1 .



Now, we can run that Lambda function image on our local Docker environment.
We can specify the port mapping(which means port 9,000,
on the local machine points to port 8080 in the image)
and we tell it which tag to run.

docker run -p 9000:8080 calculator:v1 

Above starts the lambda environment


Now to test
curl "http://localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations" -d '{"x":62, "y":21}

'Date' here is the version of the api
